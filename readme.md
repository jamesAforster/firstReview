School reports company who help parents find out how students have done on tests.

Comma separated grades, I need to produce a simple summary report using that.

Comma separated grades from a class who have sat a test looks like: "Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green".

Summary report includes an overview of how often the grades are occurring.

Input: "Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green"

Output: "Green: 3\nAmber: 1\nRed: 1"

It could be that some of these grades have been misspelt by the teachers, in which case these should be in a fourth category called 'uncounted'.
